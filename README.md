## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code can be run with the ANaconda distribution of Python. Python 3 was used to do the analysis.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

To answer the main question how to best get a job as a developer I used Stack Overflow data from 2017 and was interested in the following aspects:

1. What are the most important aspects when hiring a software developer?
2. At which platform should I maintain a job profile?
3. How do you even know that a company is hiring?


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook to show my analysis related to the above questions. The notebook contains exploratory analysis to answer these questions. Markdown cells and comments were used to show the thought process for the individual steps. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@fabianromy27/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-developer-6adc6114784d).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
